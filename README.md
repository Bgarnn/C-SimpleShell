** SimpleShell - Simple Unix Shell Implementation

Welcome to SimpleShell, a project that brings the power of a Unix shell to your fingertips. SimpleShell is a minimalist shell implementation that allows users to interact with the operating system through a command-line interface, providing a lightweight and versatile environment for executing commands and managing processes.

** Project Overview **

- What does SimpleShell do?
    - SimpleShell is a simplified Unix shell that interprets and executes commands entered by the user. It offers a command-line interface for interacting with the operating system, allowing users to run programs, manage processes, and navigate the file system. SimpleShell is an excellent introduction to shell programming and system-level interactions.

- Key Features
    - Command Execution: SimpleShell interprets and executes user-entered commands, providing an efficient interface for running programs.
    - Environment Variables: The project supports environment variables, allowing users to customize their shell environment and pass information to executed commands.
    - Process Management: SimpleShell manages processes, enabling users to run commands in the background, foreground, or manage pipelines.

** How to Compile SimpleShell **

To compile the SimpleShell program, follow these straightforward steps:

  - Clone the Repository:
      - `git clone git@github.com:Bgarnn/C-SimpleShell.git`
      - `cd C-SimpleShell`
  - Compile the Program:
      - `make`: This will generate the `minishell` executable.
  - Clean the Build:
      - `make clean`: This removes the object files, leaving only the compiled program.

** Now you can use SimpleShell to interact with the operating system through a command-line interface! **

** Usage Example **

`./minishell`

(This will start the SimpleShell prompt, allowing you to enter commands and interact with the shell.)
